🚀 Improved Hotel Reservation System (GUI) – Prompt
Problem Statement:
Develop a Hotel Reservation System (GUI) in Java using MySQL as the database. The system must support hotel room management, guest tracking, and reservation handling while adhering to OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

📌 Core Functionalities:
1. Database Setup (MySQL)
Create a relational database schema with the following entities:
Rooms: Room Number, Type (Single/Double/Suite), Price, Status (Available/Booked/Maintenance).
Guests: Name, Email, Phone Number, Membership Status.
Reservations: Reservation ID, Guest ID, Room Number, Check-in Date, Check-out Date, Payment Status.
Establish relationships using foreign keys for proper data integrity.
2. Java Application Features
✅ CRUD Operations for:

Rooms: Add, update, delete, and view available rooms.
Guests: Register guests, update details, and track visit history.
Reservations: Create, modify, cancel, and extend bookings.
✅ Room Categorization & Pricing Tiers

Set dynamic pricing based on seasons, weekends, or promotions.
✅ Dynamic Room Status Tracking

Auto-update room status after check-out, cleaning, or maintenance.
✅ Multiple Room Booking Per Guest

Allow guests to book multiple rooms under one reservation.
✅ Auto-Assign Best Available Room

Suggest the best available room based on guest preferences (e.g., Sea View, King Bed).
✅ Booking Extensions & Early Checkouts

Allow stay extensions based on room availability.
Adjust the bill dynamically.
3. Guest Management Enhancements
✅ Loyalty & Membership Program

Track guest visits and offer discounts for repeat bookings.
✅ Guest Preferences & Special Requests

Store preferences like room type, food, and amenities.
✅ Blacklisting Feature

Maintain a list of guests with bad records (e.g., no-shows, damages).
4. Payments & Billing
✅ Multiple Payment Methods

Accept Cash, Credit Cards, bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and Bank Transfers.
✅ Invoice Generation (PDF/Print)

Automatically generate a PDF invoice with room details and charges.
✅ Late Payment & Cancellation Fees

Charge guests for late payments or cancellations after a deadline.
✅ Tax & Discount System

Implement VAT, service charges, and custom discounts dynamically.
5. Admin Dashboard & Reports
✅ Real-time Dashboard with Graphs & Charts

Display Occupancy Rate, Revenue, Available Rooms, and Bookings using JavaFX.
✅ Reservation Analytics & Trends

Track the busiest months and most booked rooms.
✅ User Access Control (Admin vs Receptionist)

Admin: Full access.
Receptionist: Limited access to reservations.
✅ SMS & Email Notifications

Send booking confirmations and check-in reminders via email/SMS (Twilio API or SMTP).
6. System Optimization & Security
✅ Backup & Restore Database

Enable daily automatic backups.
✅ Logging & Activity Tracking

Log every action (e.g., reservation creation, payments).
✅ Two-Factor Authentication for Admins

Implement OTP-based login for enhanced security.
✅ Data Encryption

Encrypt guest phone numbers and emails.
